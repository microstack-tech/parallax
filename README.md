# Parallax Core

Reference Golang implementation of the **Parallax protocol**.

> **Parallax** is a Proof-of-Work timechain protocol designed to merge the security model of Bitcoin with the programmability of the EVM. It combines Bitcoin’s fixed monetary rules with Ethereum’s virtual machine to deliver a scarce, decentralized, and programmable timechain.

## Building from Source

Parallax requires **Go 1.25+** and a C compiler.

```bash
make prlx
```

Build the full suite:

```bash
make all
```

## Executables

Binaries are located under `build/bin`:

| Command        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`prlx`** | Main CLI client. Runs full, archive, or light nodes; exposes JSON-RPC over HTTP, WS, and IPC. |
| `clef`         | Stand-alone signer for secure account operations. |
| `devp2p`       | Networking utilities to inspect and interact at the P2P layer. |
| `abigen`       | Generates type-safe Go bindings from contract ABIs. |
| `bootnode`     | Lightweight discovery node to bootstrap networks. |
| `pvm`          | Execute and debug PVM bytecode snippets in isolation. |
| `rlpdump`      | Decode RLP structures into a human-readable form. |

## Running a Node

Mainnet (interactive console):

```bash
prlx console
```

Testnet:

```bash
prlx --testnet console
```
