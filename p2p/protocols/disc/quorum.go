// QuorumThreshold is the minimum number of distinct address-group peers

// peer never refreshes its receivedAt. The age sweep therefore exempts
// reports whose peer is still in the last-known connected set (see
// evictStaleLocked) and only reaps orphans — reports from a peer whose
// Disconnect() hook never fired (a crash mid-shutdown, or a code path
// that bypasses handler.Run's defer). Genuinely-gone peers are removed
